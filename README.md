## 🎮 What is AngleMaze?

AngleMaze is an educational game that combines **geometry** and **programming fundamentals** in one package. Students embark on a thrilling maze adventure where they must use their mathematical skills and coding knowledge to navigate through challenging pathways.

## ✨ How It Works

Players control their character using three simple programming commands:
- 🔄 **`steve.forward()`** - Move ahead through the maze
- ➡️ **`steve.right()`** - Rotate clockwise  
- ⬅️ **`steve.left()`** - Rotate counterclockwise

### 📐 The Learning Challenge
Here's where it gets exciting! Students must use **physical protractors** against their screens to accurately measure the angles needed for each rotation command. This hands-on approach bridges the gap between digital learning and tactile mathematical tools.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

**Mathematical Skills:**
- Practical protractor usage
- Angle measurement accuracy
- Spatial reasoning development

**Programming Concepts:**
- Basic command execution
- Sequential thinking
- Problem-solving through code

**Critical Thinking:**
- Path planning and strategy
- Trial and error learning
- Logical reasoning

## 🚪 The Goal

Navigate through the maze pathways and reach the **exit point marked by red doors**. Each successful journey reinforces both geometry skills and programming logic!

## 🌟 Why AngleMaze?

- **Hands-On Learning**: Physical protractors meet digital challenges
- **Dual Skill Development**: Mathematics and coding in one game
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Learning disguised as adventure
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Students build confidence as they advance
